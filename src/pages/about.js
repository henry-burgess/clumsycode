        <h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Henry! Originally from Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º&nbsp;, I relocated to Saint Louis, MO after I graduated to 
          work as a software engineer in a neuroscience lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this blog, I want to document some of my adventures in Saint Louis, just like a journal.
          I'll throw in some technical content as well, but I'll also try and include some photos and 
          posts about my other adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I try to get out and about to see all the sights and sounds. Otherwise, I 
          enjoy tinkering with the things I usually talk about on this blog, or trying to learn how to 
          use my espresso machine properly.
